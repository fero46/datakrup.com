> ###Turkchat.de
> [![Turkchat100x100](/images/turkchat100x100.png)](http://www.turkchat.de/)  While I worked as freelance, I have created for a customer [Turkchat.de](http://www.turkchat.de/) . It's a turkish social chat platform written in ruby on rails. 


> ###ZPong
> [![Turkchat100x100](/images/pong.png)](http://github.com/fero46/zpong)  Z-Pong is a never ending (or continued) project (coded in 5 hours in 2001) with a very ugly source-code for free. It's under the GPL v. 2. If you like to checkout go to [Github](http://github.com/fero46/zpong).
