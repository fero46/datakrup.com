About this site
===============
When I started datakrup.com, I used wordpress as CMS. But it was not my taste. I had no controll and it was written in php. So I need a better solution and finaly I found one. [Jekyll](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/). I use for the stylesheet generation [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/). The stylesheet from this site was inspired by a theme called *midnight* from textmate. You can checkout the sourcecode for this Site at [Github](http://github.com/fero46/datakrup.com).
