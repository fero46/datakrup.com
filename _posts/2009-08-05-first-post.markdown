title: Reset Blog
---

After long time, i decided to reset my website. Why ? Because Wordpress is for this site to much. I want a simple site management tool. And finaly I found one <a href="http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">Jekyll</a>. I put the code for this site on <a href="http://github.com/fero46/datakrup.com">Github</a>. If you like you can check it out and fork it :-)
